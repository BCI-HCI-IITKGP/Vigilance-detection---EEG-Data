*Template used to collect data:

Initially, each participant was asked to relax for duration of ten minutes. Thereafter, in the next five minutes we asked participants to fill subjective questionnaires. After this, a five minutes’ instruction, demonstration and practice session was arranged for each participant, which was followed by the actual EEG data recording of 20 minutes. During the data recording the participants were asked to avoid, as far as possible, movement of any kind except for responding to the target stimuli. This experiment was conducted once with each participant. Moreover, only a single participant’s data was recorded in a day. The data recording was done between 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM as per the availability of the participants.

*Vigilance Task: 

We used the popular Mackworth Clock Test for the vigilance detection experiment. In this task, the task of the participant is to monitor a red pointer moving in front of a black background in steps like the seconds’ hand of a clock and responds when the clock randomly skips a beat. In a session, whenever the clock skips a beat, the user has to promptly respond by pressing the "space bar" key. The data is coolected from 10 subjects (8 male and 2 female).
